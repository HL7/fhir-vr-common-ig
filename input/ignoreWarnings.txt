# We have tried to get rid of this warning, and Lloyd has made multiple changes to the code/files and it still doesn't appear to be working, so we are suppressing this warning for ballot
The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG. A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts. To see the differences, perform a file compare on 'template/jira-current.xml' (a normalized view of what is in Github) and 'template/jira-new.xml' (reflects current IG content)
