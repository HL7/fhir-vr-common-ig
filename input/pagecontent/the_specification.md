The Vital Records Common FHIR Profile Library is not a stand-alone implementation guide (IG). The contained profiles are used in other Vital Records IGs such as Birth and Fetal Death Reporting and Birth Defects Reporting. It is a mechanism to enable easy re-use of profiles across IGs and prevent multiple copies of profiles in different IGs.
